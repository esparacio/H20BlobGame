README - H2O BLOB

GAME OVERVIEW:

The goal of the game is save your GrandBlob! He is freezing to death because of the climate and Blobothermia. You need to find all magical plants to save your GrandBlob. To find all the plants, you’ll have to use all your H20 powers - from ice, to water, to vapor. Once you find all the plants, you’ll need to place them around your GrandBlob to bring him back to life.
